* check if the splash daemon is really running when reading the PID file
  - read of /proc/<pid>/stat, tokenize by ' ', should get (splash_util)
* writing to the splash FIFO should never block!
* save the scvs to svcs_stop like it's done with svcs_start
* do not run the splash code when called from runscript by the user
* add support for splash profiling
* the initial switch to silent doesn't work (and switch to verbose too)
