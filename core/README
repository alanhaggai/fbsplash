splashutils -- userspace utilities for the framebuffer splash screen
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This package provides a set of programs and scripts that can be used
to provide a visually attractive environment during system boot-up,
reboot and shutdown.

For installation instructions, have a look at the INSTALL file.

Here's a short description of provided programs, scripts and documents:

1. Programs

   splash_util
   -----------
   The core application of this package. Provides support for the silent
   splash mode. Can be used as a command-line tool or run in daemon mode.

   fbcondecor_helper
   -----------------
   A simple and small program run directly by the kernel to:
    - initialize the silent mode during early stages of the boot-up process,
	- provide the kernel with background images and theme configuration
	  for the verbose splash mode.

   This program is only of any use if the kernel has been patched with
   the 'fbcondecor' patch. The patch can be downloaded from the splashutils
   webpage.

   For technical documentation on the kernel<->userspace fbcondecor interface
   please refer to <kernel sources>/Documentation/fb/fbcondecor.txt.

2. Scripts

   bootsplash2fbsplash
   -------------------
   Converts bootsplash theme files to a format acceptable by splashutils.
   Might not always work correctly and some manual adjustment of the
   resulting config files might be necessary.

   splash_geninitramfs
   -------------------
   Generates initramfs images with data necessary to initialize verbose
   and silent splash during early boot-up.

   splash_resize
   -------------
   Automatically generates theme config files for new resolutions. Might
   not always work correctly and some manual adjustment of the resulting
   config files might be necessary.

   splash_manager
   --------------
   Performs various splash-related tasks in a user-friendly way. It
   allows the user to easily set and test themes, take screenshots
   of silent and verbose splash screens, and to replay recorded boot
   sequences.

3. Documentation

   docs/bootsplash_compatibility
   -----------------------------
   A few notes about this package's compatibility with bootsplash.

   docs/daemon
   -----------
   Description of the splash daemon communication protocol. Probably only
   useful to people developing support scripts for different Linux
   distributions.

   docs/early_bootup
   -----------------
   A short explanation of the early-userspace concept and some info
   about creation and usage of splash initramfs images.

   docs/kernel_parameters
   ----------------------
   A list of recognized kernel parameters.

   docs/quickstart
   ---------------
   A very simplified intro to splashutils for people who REALLY don't have
   time to have a look at the rest of the documentation.

   docs/theme_format
   -----------------
   Theme format specification. Useful for theme developers.

Any comments, suggestions and bug-reports are appreciated.
