Installation instructions
-------------------------

Before you begin compiling splashutils, please make sure that klibc
1.0.14 or newer is installed on your system. It is essential that
your klibc provides the `klcc' wrapper. Without `klcc' it will be
impossible to build the splash_helper binary.

If you have downloaded the 'lite' version of splashutils, you'll have
to manually download the source code of a few helper libraries and then
extract it to the 'libs/' subdirectory. Depending on selected features
these will be:

 * jpeglib
 * png support: zlib, libpng
 * ttf support: freetype2

After making sure that your system is properly configured, you can run
the ./configure script to select various optional featues. Use
`./configure --help` to see what options are available. Once this step
is done, you should proceed with:

 # make
 # make install

The following make options might be useful:

QUIET=false
 Makes the make output more verbose; especially useful in case
 of compilation issues.

JPEGSRC, LPNGSRC, ZLIBSRC, FT22SRC
 Use these options to specify where the source of a given
 library is located (when using the 'lite' splashutils version).

 Example:
 #  make JPEGSRC=libs/jpeg-6b ZLIBSRC=libs/zlib-1.2.3 \
         LPNGSRC=libs/libpng-1.2.8
