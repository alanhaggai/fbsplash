Installation instructions
-------------------------

Before you begin compiling splashutils, please make sure that klibc
1.0.14 or newer is installed on your system.

If you have downloaded a 'lite' version of splashutils, you'll have
to manually download the sourcecode of a few helper libraries and then
extract it to the 'libs/' subdirectory. Depending on selected supported
features these will be:

 * jpeglib
 * png support: zlib, libpng
 * ttf support: freetype2

After you've made sure that your system is properly configured,
you can run the ./configure script to select various optional
featues. Use `./configure --help` to see what options are available.
Once this is done, you should proceed with:

 # make
 # make install

The following make options might be useful:

QUIET=false
 Makes the make output more verbose; especially useful in case 
 of compilation issues.

JPEGSRC, LPNGSRC, ZLIBSRC, FT22SRC
 Use these options to specify where the sourcecode for a given
 library is located (when you're using the 'lite' splashutils 
 version).

 Example:
 #  make JPEGSRC=libs/jpeg-6b ZLIBSRC=libs/zlib-1.2.3 \
         LPNGSRC=libs/libpng-1.2.8
