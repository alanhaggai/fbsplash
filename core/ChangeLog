16 May 2005 * <spock@gentoo.org> * splashutils-1.1.9.6
 - Merged MNG support code by Bernard Blackham <bernard(at)blackham.com.au>.
   This is only a stub for now, but it means that full support for animations
   will surely be coming in the next few revisions.
 - Fixed a few box rendering issues in 16bpp modes.
 - Added the '--no8bpp' option to splash_geninitramfs.

 - Released splashutils in two versions -- the traditional 'full' tarball
   and a new 'lite' one, which includes only the core splashutils code.

   libs/ subdirectory. The 'lite' package should be a great bandwidth

   libraries used in splashutils.

   for now).

21 Mar 2005 * <spock@gentoo.org> * splashutils-1.1.9.2, miscsplashutils-0.1.3

 A bugfix release of splashutils. Fixed bugs:
  - #85293 - compilation problems on amd64
  - 8bpp modes fix (thanks to Bernard Blackham <bernard(at)blackham.com.au>)

 Additionally, the following new features have been implemented:
  - Support for switching between verbose and silent with F2.
    In order to take advantage of this new feature, one has to use a kernel
    compiled with the user event interface enabled (CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV=y).
  - Speed improvements for solid color boxes (thanks to Bernard Blackham).
  - Support for compiling splashutils without any dependencies on fbsplash
     (ie. silent mode only).

09 Mar 2005 * <spock@gentoo.org> * splashutils-1.1.9.1
 - Splash protocol v1 support is back in place. That means you can use
   splashutils-1.1.9.1 with all currently available versions of fbsplash.
   Still, fbsplash 0.9.2 is the recommended version.
 - Improved the fade-in code for truecolor modes. The fading should be much
   more smooth now.

07 Mar 2005 * <spock@gentoo.org> * splashutils-1.1.9
 Major changes in the architecture and in the code. A list of
 more important ones:
  - The splash daemon mode - makes things a lot faster and cleaner. This
    will be the preferred way of using splashutils for the silent mode
    from now on. The old run-paint-exit, run-paint-exit, ... scheme will
    still be supported, but all new features will be going into the daemon.
  - The silent mode has it's own TTY. By default - tty8. This can be changed
    with the 'tty:<n>' kernel command line splash= parameter.
  - Support for splash protocol v2. This means that this version of
    splashutils will work with fbsplash-0.9.2.
  - Initial support for graphical effects. For now, this is the initial
    'fade-in'. Try adding 'fadein' to the kernel command line splash=
    parameter.
  - Support for switching between silent and verbose. Silent -> verbose
    switch can be done with F2 or the standard Ctrl+Alt+F1 combination.
    Verbose -> silent can be done only with Ctrl+Alt+F<n> (for now),
    where n depends on the tty the user has chosen at boot.
  - Support for TrueType fonts in the daemon and in the splash_helper.
    This can be turned off in the config.h file if it's not required.
  - Support for the 'text' object. Thanks to the 'exec' flag the text
    to be displayed can be generated on-the-fly. Yes, this means that
    you can get fortunes on your verbose/silent screen, displayed in a
    nice TTF font ;)
  - Enhanced support for icons in the splashutils-gentoo package. The
    service list is automatically and transparently computed and cached,
    and exported to user scripts by the means of the splash_svclist_get()
    function.
  - Proper handling of the objects chain. This means that the items from
    the config file are painted in the order in which they appear.
    The previous version drew all the boxes first.
  - Support for exporting the background buffer to a file. This can be
    used to call an external app every time the silent screen is about
    to be repainted. This feature is experimental at the moment, largely
    untested and there's not much you can do with it right now (unless
    you write your own programs to take advantage of it).

 Consider the whole release a little experimental. Don't think of it as
 of something you can just package into whatever format you use and drop
 into your system.

 I'm sorry for not including any real documentation in this version
 -- it will be added in one of the next bugfix releases that will surely
 follow. For now, let this changelog, splash_util -h, the Gentoo
 initscripts from splashutils-gentoo and The Code Itself be your guides ;)

27 Jan 2005 * <spock@gentoo.org> * splashutils-0.9.1
 Added numerous new features and bugfixes:
  - support for devfs device names (bug #75515)
  - a splash_geninitramfs fix (bug #68518)
  - support for theme-defined ttf fonts
  - support for boot icons

 Note that some of these are undocumented and usused at this point.
 Please wait for baselayout updates (bug #78492) and/or new themes
 to see them in action.
