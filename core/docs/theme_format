splashutils recognize the following directives in the config files in
/etc/splash:

o jpeg=<path>
  Full path to the JPG background image for verbose mode 

o pic=<path>
  Full path to the JPG/PNG background image for verbose mode

o silentjpeg=<path>
  Full path to the JPG backgruond image for silent mode

o silentpic=<path>
  Full path to the JPG/PNG background image for silent mode

o pic256=<path>
  Full path to the PNG background image for verbose splash mode and 8bpp
  framebuffer modes. 

  NOTES:
  - The image can have a maximum of 240 colors. 16 colors are taken by fbcon 
    and cannot be used in the picture.

o silentpic256=<path>
  Full path to the PNG background image for silent splash mode and 8bpp
  framebuffer modes.

  NOTES:
  - The image can have a maximum of 256 colors.
 
o bgcolor=<n>
  Background color that is to be treated as transparent by fbcon. Usually 0.

o tx=<n>
  The x coordinate of the upper left corner of the text window. 0 means 'the
  left edge of the screen'.

o ty=<n>
  The y coordinate of the upper left corner of the text window. 0 means 'the
  top edge of the screen'

o tw=<n>
  The width of the text window. n cannot be greater than x resolution.

o th=<n>
  The height of the text windows. n cannot be greater than y resolution.

o box [flags] <x0> <y0> <x1> <y1> <color1> [color2 color3 color4]
  Draws a box on the image. 

  Flags:
  silent - The box is drawn only in silent mode. If a box doesn't have this 
           flag set, it's drawn only in verbose mode.
  noover - This stands for no-overpaint. Boxes with this flag set are painted
           only when progress == 0 or the repaint command is used.
  inter  - The box will be interpolated with the following one, based on the
           value of progress.

  x0, y0 - coordinates of the upper left corner of the box
  x1, y1 - coordinates of the lower right corner of the box

  Colors are specified one of the following formats:
  #rrggbb or #rrggbbaa.
  aa = alpha, 00 - translucent, 255 - solid

  If only color1 is specified, the box is filled with the color.
  If all four colors are specified, then:
  
  color1   is the color of the   upper left    corner of the box,
  color2   is the color of the   upper right   corner of the box,
  color3   is the color of the   lower left    corner of the box,
  color4   is the color of the   lower right   corner of the box,

  and the box is filled with a gradient formed by these colors.

o icon <path> <x> <y> [event service]
  Draws an icon (a PNG image) at coordinates x, y [if an event happens].

  event can be one of the following:
  svc_inactive_start, 	svc_inactive_stop,
  svc_started, 		svc_stopped,
  svc_start_failed, 	svc_stop_failed,
  svc_start, 		svc_stop,

  service is (surprise, surprise!) the name of the service.

  An icon will be rendered on the screen only if the service name
  is found in a environment variable appropriate for the selected 
  event. The list of variable names corresponding to the events
  follows:
  SPL_SVC_INACTIVE_START	SPL_SVC_INACTIVE_STOP
  SPL_SVC_STARTED		SPL_SVC_STOPPED
  SPL_SVC_START_FAILED		SPL_SVC_STOP_FAILED
  SPL_SVC_START			SPL_SVC_STOP

  Each of this variables can contain a space-separated list of 
  service names.

o rect <attr> <x0> <y0> <x1> <y1>
  Describes a rectangular area on the screen with some special
  attribute attr. Available attributes:

  repaint - causes the area to be repainted every time splash_util
            is called with the 'paint' command (with 'repaint', the
	    whole screen is repainted)
