splashutils provide almost complete bootsplash compatibility when it comes to
the theme files. It's possible to use old bootsplash themes with fbsplash/
splashutils with little or no work (usually the picture paths will need some 
adjusting and the config files will have to be renamed). 

Note that some settings from the old themes are ignored with fbsplash. Please
have a look at a file describing the splashutils theme format to see which 
ones are supported.

To make the process of converting files easier, a utility script called 
bootsplash2fbsplash is provided as a part of the splashutils package.

Other parts of the system, for example the /proc/splash interface, have either
been changed or are completely gone. With some tweaking it should be possible 
to get scripts designed for bootsplash working with splashutils.

The most important things that have changed:

- The /proc/splash interface is gone. Use splash_util instead.
- Support for bootsplash initrds is gone. Refer to 'early_bootup' for
  instructions on how to make fbsplash work during the kernel initialization.
- The default theme directory has been moved to /etc/splash.
- Config file naming scheme is slightly different:
  /etc/splash/<theme-name>/<xres>x<yres>.cfg
