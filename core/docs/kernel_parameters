To make sure that the silent mode works correctly with this version of
splashutils, it is required that you add either
'quiet CONSOLE=/dev/tty1' or 'console=tty1' to your kernel command line.

'quiet' will prevent most of the initial kernel messages from being displayed.
'CONSOLE=/dev/tty1' will redirect all initscript messages to tty1.
'console=tty1' will redirect both kernel and initscript messages to tty1.

It is also possible to override some splash parameters defined in the
system configuration files with options passed on the kernel command
line. All splash options are separated by commas and they should form
a continuous configuration string. The following options are recognized:

 - off        - Disable silent and verbose splash (default).
 - verbose    - Start the system with a verbose splash screen.
 - silent     - Start the system in the 'silent' mode. (all messages from
                the kernel and from the initscripts are covered by a picture
                and thus hidden from the user)
 - fadein     - Use a 'fade from black' effect to display the silent image.
 - fadeout    - Use a 'fade to black' effect after the bootup is finished.
 - theme:foo  - Use theme 'foo'.
 - tty:n      - Sse the n-th tty as the silent tty. Default silent tty is
                tty8.
 - kdgraphics - Run in KDGRAPHICS mode. Use of this option is discouraged
                but might be necessary when some kernel drivers try to
                display messages on the foreground tty despite the 'quiet'
                option.

Additionally, the following options may be recognized, if the system
scripts provide support for them:

 - profile    - Save splash profiling information. The data saved in a
                splash profile file can be used to replay the boot sequence
                using the splash_manager script.
 - insane     - Skip sanity checks.

A sample splash kernel command line setting:
  splash=silent,fadein,theme:linuxrocks,tty:12

A sample full kernel command line:
  root=/dev/hda5 video=vesafb:1024x768-32@85
  splash=silent,fadein,theme:linuxrocks,tty:12 console=tty1

Please note that the default splash mode is 'off'. You have to explicitly
specify 'silent' or 'verbose' on the kernel command line in order to get
the splash working.

The splash helper recognizes the following additional environment
variables:

 BOOT_MSG="message" - use 'message' for the initial greeting (instead of
                      'Initializing the kernel...') for the silent splash.

 PROGRESS="xx" - set the initial progress variable to 'xx' instead of '0'.

The BOOT_MSG option can also be given on the kernel command line.
Note that these additional parameters are never specified as a part of the
splash= config string. The correct way of using them is:

.. splash=silent,theme:linuxrocks console=tty1 BOOT_MSG="Welcome to Linux!" ..
