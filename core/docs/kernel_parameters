To make sure the silent mode works correctly with this version of 
splashutils, additional kernel command line arguments are required.

It is recommeneded that you add 'quiet' and 'CONSOLE=/dev/tty1' to
your kernel command line. The first option will prevent any initial
kernel messages from being displayed. This is required for the silent
mode, unless you have compiled splashutils with CONFIG_SILENT_KD_GRAPHICS.
The second option will instruct init and its children processes to 
output all messages to /dev/tty1 and not to the foreground tty.

It is also possible to override some splash parameters set up in the 
system configuration files with options passed on the kernel command 
line. All splash options are separated by commas and they should form
a continuous configuration string. The following options are recognized:

 - off        - disables silent and verbose splash
 - verbose    - start the system with a verbose splash screen
 - silent     - start the system in the 'silent' mode (all messages from
                the kernel and from the initscripts are covered by a picture
	        and thus hidden from the user)
 - fadein     - use a 'fade from black' effect to display the silent image
 - theme:foo  - use theme 'foo'
 - tty:n      - use the n-th tty as the silent tty. Default silent tty is 
                tty8.

A sample splash kernel command line setting:
  splash=silent,fadein,theme:linuxrocks,tty:12
 
A sample full kernel command line:
  root=/dev/hda5 video=vesafb:1024x768-32@85 splash=silent,fadein,theme:linuxrocks,tty:12 quiet CONSOLE=/dev/tty1
