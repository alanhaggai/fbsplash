To make sure the silent mode works correctly with this version of 
splashutils, additional kernel command line arguments are required.

It is required that you add either 'quiet CONSOLE=/dev/tty1' or
'console=tty1' to your kernel command line. 

'quiet' will prevent most initial kernel messages from being displayed.
'CONSOLE=/dev/tty1' will redirect all initscript messages to tty1.
'console=tty1' will redirect both kernel and initscript messages to tty1.

It is also possible to override some splash parameters set up in the 
system configuration files with options passed on the kernel command 
line. All splash options are separated by commas and they should form
a continuous configuration string. The following options are recognized:

 - off        - disables silent and verbose splash (default)
 - verbose    - start the system with a verbose splash screen
 - silent     - start the system in the 'silent' mode (all messages from
                the kernel and from the initscripts are covered by a picture
	        and thus hidden from the user)
 - fadein     - use a 'fade from black' effect to display the silent image
 - theme:foo  - use theme 'foo'
 - tty:n      - use the n-th tty as the silent tty. Default silent tty is 
                tty8
 - kdgraphics - run in KDGRAPHICS mode. Use of this option in discouraged
                but might be necessary in case of some kernel drivers that
		display messages on the foreground tty.

A sample splash kernel command line setting:
  splash=silent,fadein,theme:linuxrocks,tty:12
 
A sample full kernel command line:
  root=/dev/hda5 video=vesafb:1024x768-32@85 splash=silent,fadein,theme:linuxrocks,tty:12 console=tty1

Please note that the default splash mode is 'off', so you will need to
explicitly specify 'silent' or 'verbose' on the kernel command line in
order to get the splash working.

The splash programs recognize the following additional kernel command line
parameters:

 BOOT_MSG="message" - use 'message' for the initial greeting (instead of 
                      'Initializing the kernel...') for the silent splash.

Note that these additional parameters are never specified as a part of the
splash= config string. The correct way of using them is:

.. splash=silent,theme:linuxrocks console=tty1 BOOT_MSG="Welcome to Linux!" ..
