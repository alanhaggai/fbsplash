                      Fbsplash porting guide
                      ----------------------

Last update: 2007-08-09

This document describes how to port fbsplash to different Linux distros
and keep such ports maintainable.

1. Initscript interface
-----------------------
To be of any use, fbplash has to be integrated with the initscript system
used in a target Linux distro. There are many ways in which it can be done and
this document will provide information about two of them:

 1) using a set of shell scripts
 2) using a compiled program/library

The second way is especially useful for initscript systems that support some
sort of plugins and are themselves written in a compiled language, such as C.

2. Shell script interface
-------------------------
A skeleton for building a shell script interface is provided in
scripts/splash-functions.sh, and normally installed in
/sbin/splash-functions.sh.

This file contains a stripped-down version of an interface that was used in
Gentoo Linux once, and which can be found in splash-functions-bl1.sh, available
in `splashutils-gentoo' tarballs on the project website [1]. The tarballs also
contain a document with a detailed description of the internals of that file.
Together they should provide a good starting point for a customized shell
script interface.

3. Library interface
--------------------
Starting with 1.4, splashutils comes with a simple library (`libfbsplash') which
contains the majority of functions necessary to build an initscript interface.
`splashutils-gentoo' contains a plugin which makes use of this library.

Typically one would build an interface in the following way:

splash_lib_init();
splash_parse_kcmdline();
/* call a specific function */
splash_lib_clean();

where the specific function could be:

start() {
	splash_check_sanity();
	splash_cache_prep();
	/* start the splash daemon */
	splash_set_evdev();
}

stop() {
	/* stop the splash daemon */
	splash_cache_cleanup();
}

event() {
	splash_check_daemon();
	splash_profile();
	splash_send();
}

etc.

Please refer to the code of the Gentoo plugin and to libfbsplash.c
for further information. In case of any doubts or problems, feel
free to e-mail me :)
