       libfbsplash and libfbsplashrender documentation
	   -----------------------------------------------

Last update: 2007-08-09

This document is an introductory documentation for libfbsplash and 
libfbsplashrender.

1. Purpose
----------

Since 1.5, splashutils comes bundled with two libraries: libfbsplash
and libfbsplashrender.  The libraries have two distinct purposes:

- lifbsplash: provides functions that can be useful for integrating
  fbsplash with the initscript system or for controlling the fbsplash
  daemon from third party applications,

- libfbsplashrender: provide functions to parse splash themes and
  to display the silent splash screen (either to a memory buffer,
  or directly on the screen).  One would use libfbsplashrender e.g.
  in software suspend applications (to provide a graphical interface
  while suspending/resuming the system).

2. Usage
--------

In order to use libfbsplash, add "#include <fbsplash.h>" to your program
and link it with "-lfbsplash".

In order to use libfbsplashredner, add "#include <fbsplash.h>" to your
program and link it with "-lfbsplashrender".  If you link your program with
libfbsplashrender, you will automatically gain access to all features
provided by libfbsplash.

3. Documentation
----------------

If you want a complete reference for all functions provided by
libfbsplash and libfbsplashrender, run `make doc` in the main
splashutils directory (requires doxygen) or have a look at the code
in libfbsplash.c and libfbsplashrender.c.

3. Additional information
-------------------------

If you can't find an answer to your question in the splashutils 
documentation, feel free to mail me at spock@gentoo.org.
