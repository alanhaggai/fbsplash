This is a short guide for those who don't have time/don't bother reading
the other docs. 

Assumptions:
 o The sources for the kernel are in /usr/src/linux.
 o You have the theme default in /etc/splash.

What to do:

 1. Configure your kernel if you haven't already done so. Make sure fbsplash
    is enabled. Then build it: 
    cd /usr/src/linux ; make
 2. Build splashutils:   make
 3. Install splashutils: make install
 4. Generate an initramfs image:
    splash_geninitramfs -g /usr/src/linux/usr/initramfs_data.cpio.gz -r 1024x768 default
 5. Update your kernel bzImage
    cd /usr/src/linux ; make bzImage
 6. Install your kernel image and add splash=silent or splash=verbose to the
    kernel command line. If you choose verbose mode, you can skip steps 4 and 5.

That's about it. Reboot and enjoy ;)
