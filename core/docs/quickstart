This is a short guide for those who don't have time/don't bother reading
the other docs.

Assumptions:
 * a theme <theme> is installed in /etc/splash

What to do:

 1. Install splashutils. Please refer to the INSTALL file for detailed
    instructions on how to do that.
 2. Generate an initramfs image:
    splash_geninitramfs -g /boot/initrd-fbsplash -r 1024x768 -v <theme>
 3. Edit bootloader configuration and:

   3a) add "splash=silent,theme:<theme> console=tty1" to the kernel
       command line
   3b) make the kernel use /boot/initrd-fbsplash as it's initial ramdisk

 4. Reboot and enjoy :)
